# Welcome!

This repository is for people who love Geometry Dash, creates levels, but they don't get featured :(
Anyhoo, this repository helps you add HTML code onto my website, "The Underrated GD Levels". The plan is that I post this link into the GD Discord server, you guys can put in your code to submit your level info and IDs.
After a few levels are posted (maybe ~10?) I'll post the website itself onto the Discord. Let's see if people join. Fingers crossed, guys.

# Rules

Sure, you might want to be anxious to add your levels (or maybe not), but before you post, make sure you keep these in mind:

- Make sure the info you post is appropriate.
- Make sure the level is appropriate.
- If self-advertising, don't beg people to play it.
- DON'T beg RobTop to rate it. Don't be a Boy Of The Cones.

That's it really.
